        <h2>Section A: Respect for Authority</h2>
        <h3>1.0 General Principles</h3>
        <h4>1.1 Recognition of Authority</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All students must recognize the authority of school staff, including
            teachers, administrators, counsellors, prefects, and other personnel
            tasked with maintaining school order.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students are expected to acknowledge and respect the decisions,
            roles, and responsibilities of these authorities.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>1.2 Civility in Communication</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Students must use respectful language, tone, and gestures when
            addressing staff and authority figures.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offensive, sarcastic, or dismissive language or behaviour towards
            authority figures is strictly prohibited.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>1.3 Adherence to Rules</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All instructions and directives given by teachers or staff must be
            followed promptly and without argument.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students must comply with school rules and policies established by
            the administration.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.0 Classroom Interactions</h3>
        <h4>2.1 Following Teacher Instructions:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Students must listen attentively and follow the teacherâ€™s
            instructions during lessons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interruptions, talking back, or disruptive behaviour during class
            will not be tolerated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeated defiance will lead to interventions such as counseling or
            detention.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2.2 Requesting Clarifications:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Questions or concerns about instructions should be addressed
            respectfully by raising a hand or approaching the teacher after the
            lesson.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2.3 Classroom Participation:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Engage constructively in lessons, showing respect for the teacher's
            efforts and authority.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students are expected to actively participate in class activities
            and discussions in a constructive manner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disruptions such as speaking out of turn, distracting others, or
            refusing to engage in lessons are prohibited.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2.4 Preparedness</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Students must bring required materials and complete assigned tasks
            before coming to class.
          </li>
          <li>
            Failure to prepare will negatively impact participation grades and
            require follow-up with parents.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.0 Interactions Outside the Classroom</h3>

        <h4>3.2 Obeying Non-Teaching Staff:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Directives from non-teaching staff, such as security personnel,
            administrative staff, or cleaning personnel, must be respected.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.0 Handling Disputes with Authority</h3>
        <h4>4.1 Dispute Resolution Process:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Direct arguments or confrontations with authority figures are
            unacceptable.

        </ul>
        <h4>4.2 Parental Involvement:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For unresolved disputes, parents will be invited for discussions

        <ul>
          <li>
            Prefects and student leaders act as representatives of school
            authority and must be treated respectfully.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>5.2 Compliance with Prefect Instructions:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Students must follow reasonable instructions given by prefects,
            especially regarding discipline and adherence to school rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            Concerns about prefect conduct should be reported to a teacher or
