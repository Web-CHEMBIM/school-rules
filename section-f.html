        <h4>1.1 Importance of Participation</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Extracurricular activities (ECA) are essential for the holistic
            development of students, promoting teamwork, leadership, and
            physical fitness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Participation in ECA is considered a privilege and must be treated
            with responsibility and discipline.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>1.2 Attendance and Punctuality</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Students must attend all scheduled ECA sessions, practices, and
            events punctually.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regular attendance is mandatory to remain eligible for participation
