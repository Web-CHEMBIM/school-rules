        <h2>Section B: Attendance and Punctuality</h2>
        <h3>1.0 Attendance</h3>
        <h4>1.1 Compulsory Attendance</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Students must attend all scheduled classes, school assemblies, and
            extracurricular activities unless excused for valid reasons.
          </li>
          <li>
            Attendance will be recorded daily by teachers during each session or
            class period.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>1.2 Minimum Attendance Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Students are required to maintain a minimum attendance of 90% each
            term to be eligible for participation in exams and school
            activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students falling below this threshold without valid reasons may face
            consequences such as counselling sessions or disqualification from
            certain privileges.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>1.3 Excused Absences</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Valid reasons for absence include:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Illness (with a medical certificate).</li>
            <li>
              Family emergencies (e.g., bereavement, with a parental note).
            </li>
            <li>Pre-approved school-related activities or events.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Absences must be reported to the school administration by parents or
            guardians within 24 hours of the absence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>1.4 Unexcused absences</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Absences without a valid reason or prior notification will be
            considered unexcused.
          </li>
          <li>
            Three unexcused absences in a term will result in a formal warning
            to parents and a meeting with the school counsellor.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>1.5 Truancy</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Truancy (skipping school or classes without permission) is a serious
            offense and may result in disciplinary action, including detention
            or temporary suspension.

          <li>
            Repeated unexcused absences or late arrivals will lead to a review
